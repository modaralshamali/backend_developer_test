## Backend Developer Test:

### How to run:
 - Clone the reposetory.
 - Go to **root** folder and run these commands:

 > docker build . "image_name"

 > docker run -p 3000:3000 "image_name"

 - Use APIs in the file **backend_test_collection.postman_collection** with **postman** to test the code.
 - Good Luck ^_^.
